# a2-Bot
a discord bot that emulates an apple ][ using virtual ][

how to set up your own a2-bot
- change token to the token that your bot uses, and the in and out pipes found in config.json to the correct values for your apple ][ or emulator
- configure your emulator or apple ][ using pr#n, in#n where n is the slot of your super serial card
- insert an edited version of Eamon into your disk drive if you want that function to work on your bot.
    - the edits needed to make Eamon playable is to edit the hello file to include "15 print D$"pr#n"", and "16 print D$"in#n"" again were n is the slot of your super serial card
